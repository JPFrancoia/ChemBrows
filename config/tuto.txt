Welcome to ChemBrows, a software that helps you to tame the flood of scientific literature
--
First things first: select the journals you want to follow 

(you can change this selection afterwards in Settings)
--
Double-click on an article to see the article on the publisher's website
--
Here come the cool features: 
--
A dock appears on the left side of the window, to display/hide journal(s) 
--
Savable searches allow you to follow your topics of interest and/or your favorite authors
--
If you want to check out articles of interest later, simply put them in the TO-READ list
--
The very cool feature now: Chembrows includes machine learning ! 
--
Chembrows learns from your input and classifies the articles by "Hot Paperness"

    - Displaying AND Liking articles INCREASES the "Hot Paperness" of similar reasearch works

    - Displaying WITHOUT Liking articles DECREASES the "Hot Paperness" of similar reaseach works

--
Don't forget: the more you feed ChemBrows, the more Chembrows feeds you back with relevant articles
--
You are now ready to download articles! 

(it may take some time at the first execution, be patient...)
--
