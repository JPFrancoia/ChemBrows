INSTALL (Ubuntu)
================

You will first need to install the following package:

libatlas-base-dev

Then make ChemBrows executable, if it is not already. To do so, run in a terminal:

cd ChemBrows_a_version_number/
sudo chmod +x gui
sudo chmod ChemBrows_a_version_number/gui

Where a_version_number is the version number of the archive you downloaded. 

To start ChemBrows, run in a terminal:

./gui


Enjoy !
